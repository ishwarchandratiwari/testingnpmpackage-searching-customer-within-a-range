# Code Challenge

## Requirements

- Assignment â€“ Coding Challenge:
-We have some customer records in a text file (customers.txt) -- one customer per line, JSON lines formatted. We want to invite any customer within 100km of Dublin for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending). 
-Don't forget, you'll need to convert degrees to radians.
-The GPS coordinates for Dublin area is 53.339428, -6.257664. We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program. Package the searching algorithm as an abstraction layer and installable component through npm package.


## Usage

let searching = require('searching-customer-within-a-range');
